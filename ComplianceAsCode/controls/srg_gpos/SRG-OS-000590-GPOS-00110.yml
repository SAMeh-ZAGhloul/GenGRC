            This requirement is NA for {{{ full_name }}}.
        rationale: |-
            Disabling expired, inactive, or otherwise anomalous accounts supports the concepts of least privilege and least functionality which reduce the attack surface of the system.
        status_justification:
            This is a procedural-only requirement that is not enforced by the OS.
